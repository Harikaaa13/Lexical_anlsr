The program established a variant type token which functioned to identify keyword pockets and operator segments among punctuation symbols as well as integers and identifiers together with unrecognizable characters.
The Str.regexp is used in the program to the regular expressions establishment which matched the different token categories through distinct patterns.
After that started creating the tokenize function by defining a mutable list called tokens as a storage unit while initializing a mutable position tracker named pos in the input string.
Functionally processed each character in the input string through the while loop until every input character had completed.
The Str.string_match function explianed the matches of a pattern for the substring at pos within the while loop while following a specific order of handling these matches.
The program begins with the whitespace processing since skipping it prevented unneeded processing operations.
Prior to identification the system compared keywords against each other to stop identification errors then this leads to examine the program in the following manner.
Multi-character operators received higher priority as compared to the single-character operators. single charecter operators will do accurate recognition purposes.
The program converted string values of integer literals into integer representations during tokenization which will became IntLiteral tokens.
For both variable names and function names, the application followed naming conventions for identifier extraction to correctly identify.
All unknown input was shown as Unknown tokens for detecting possible syntax mistakes in the goiven input program.
The reversal procedure for the token list happened at the terminus to sustain correct order after the additions occurred in reverse direction.
The print_tokens function traverses through the token list in an understandable format, to display the combination of token types and values
The main function explained and works as to obtain input from the user and tokenize it before printing the resulting token list.
This is the way i explained all the code here and sending my code file and output file as well.
